I would like to thank u/kap89 on Reddit.com for giving me access to his original digital chess set called
Anarchy chess and the subreddit r/AnarchyChess for encouraging me in making of this app. If you like
the look of the pieces and you may want to checkout lichess.com which let's you change the look of
your pieces to this style. Please checkout the original creators at https://github.com/sharechess/sharechess.
